Teaching you "complete" NLP (Natural Language Processing) is a vast undertaking since it covers a broad range of topics, techniques, and tools. However, I can guide you through the key concepts, techniques, and resources, giving you a strong foundation to continue learning on your own.
1. Introduction to NLP
•	What is NLP?
NLP is a field of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It involves processing and analyzing large amounts of natural language data.
•	Applications of NLP:
o	Text Classification: Spam detection, sentiment analysis.
o	Machine Translation: Translating text from one language to another.
o	Speech Recognition: Converting spoken language into text.
o	Chatbots: Automated customer service agents.
o	Information Retrieval: Search engines.
2. Basic Concepts
•	Tokenization:
Splitting text into smaller units, like words or sentences.
o	Word Tokenization: Splitting sentences into words.
o	Sentence Tokenization: Splitting paragraphs into sentences.
•	Stop Words:
Common words (like "the", "and", "is") that are often removed before processing text because they carry less meaningful information.
•	Stemming and Lemmatization:
o	Stemming: Reducing words to their base or root form (e.g., "running" → "run").
o	Lemmatization: Similar to stemming but ensures the root word is a valid word (e.g., "better" → "good").
•	Bag of Words (BoW):
Representing text by the frequency of words, ignoring grammar and word order.
•	TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency):
A statistical measure used to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a collection of documents.
3. Advanced Techniques
•	Word Embeddings:
o	Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText: Techniques to convert words into continuous vector space where similar words are closer together.
•	Sequence Models:
o	RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks): Useful for sequential data like text.
o	LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory): A type of RNN that handles long-term dependencies.
•	Attention Mechanisms:
o	Transformers: Advanced models for processing sequential data. Key component of models like BERT and GPT.
•	Pretrained Models:
o	BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers): State-of-the-art model for various NLP tasks.
o	GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer): A model that generates human-like text.
4. NLP Pipelines
•	Text Preprocessing:
Involves cleaning and preparing the text data, including tokenization, stop-word removal, and lemmatization/stemming.
•	Feature Extraction:
Converting text into numerical representations (e.g., BoW, TF-IDF, word embeddings).
•	Modeling:
Using machine learning or deep learning models to make predictions or classifications based on the text data.
•	Evaluation:
Assessing the performance of the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. Hands-on with NLP Libraries
•	NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):
A powerful Python library for working with human language data.
o	Install: pip install nltk
•	spaCy:
An advanced NLP library for industrial-strength NLP tasks.
o	Install: pip install spacy
•	Transformers (Hugging Face):
A library providing thousands of pretrained models to perform tasks like text classification, information retrieval, translation, etc.
o	Install: pip install transformers
6. Practical Projects
To solidify your understanding, work on the following projects:
•	Sentiment Analysis:
Build a model to classify the sentiment of a given text (positive, negative, neutral).
•	Text Summarization:
Implement models that generate concise summaries of longer documents.
•	Named Entity Recognition (NER):
Identify and classify named entities (like person names, organizations, dates) in text.
7. Resources for Further Learning
•	Books:
o	"Speech and Language Processing" by Daniel Jurafsky and James H. Martin.
o	"Natural Language Processing with Python" by Steven Bird, Ewan Klein, and Edward Loper.
•	Courses:
o	Coursera: "Natural Language Processing" by Deeplearning.ai.
o	edX: "Natural Language Processing with Python" by Microsoft.
